/* Write a JavaScript program to check whether a matrix is a diagonal matrix or not. In linear algebra, a diagonal matrix is a matrix in which the entries outside the main diagonal are all zero (the diagonal from the upper left to the lower right). 
Example:
[1, 0, 0], [0, 2, 0], [0, 0, 3] ]) = true
[1, 0, 0], [0, 2, 3], [0, 0, 3] ]) = false */
