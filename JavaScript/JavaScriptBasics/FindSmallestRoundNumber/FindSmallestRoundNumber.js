/* Write a JavaScript program to find the smallest round number not less than a given value. 
Note: A round number is informally considered to be an integer that ends with one or more zeros.[3] So, 590 is rounder than 592, but 590 is less round than 600. */

// Function to find the nearest round number
function nearest_round_number(num) {
  // Loop until the number is divisible by 10
  while (num % 10) {

// Test cases
console.log(nearest_round_number(56)); // Output: 60
